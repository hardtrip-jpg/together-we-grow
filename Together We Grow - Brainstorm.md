Together We Grow is a life sim simulator where you play as new parent, and witness the growth of your children and family. The game spans 25 years as you schedule events every year and make decisions based on random events. Once decisions are made, short cutscenes will be played that reflect your decisions and progress the story. 

## THERE IS NO WRONG DECISION
the game is about life and how we learn to overcome it. its about the memories we make. and most importantly, it is about ***EXPERIMENTATION*** The game should will relatively short (3hour run) and should allow the player to experiment with their family. The player should be allowed to ask "What happens if i force my child to play soccer?". Additionally, 
## THERE IS NO PERFECT SOLUTION
Every outcome and decision will come with positives and negatives. Spend time with your family, career wont grow. Too much time at work, kids wont be happy. Spend too much time with kids and relationship with partner will strain. At the end, no person is perfect so don't expect your kids to be.


Gameplay flip flops through 2 main modes of interaction.

## 1 - Decisions making

Throughout the game, random events and prompts might occur. Every time this happens, a decision will be made. These decisions affect your personal development and your families. These events might include birthdays, activities, gifts for your child, or your boss asking to work overtime.

Additionally, at the beginning of the game, you will be asked to name your child, to name yourself, pick your love, answer a quiz to determine job bracket, your home, etc. Things that will establish how the game will act out.


## 2 - Scheduling

Ever month or year (undecided) you will be tasked to schedule. These will involve tetronimo type blocks which will represent activites you do, activities you force your kid to do, how much time you choose to spend at work, with your kids, with your wife, or all of your family. Once youve selected a schedule, the game will go through your schedule and see that year/months outcome.


## 3 - Stats/Tag

Stats -> Tags -> Events/Options

Everything you do will affect stats in game. Then checks at random or specific times will compare stats and pick out events to determine the story. 

For example, 

It is child's birthday, compare to previous stats, if happiness is very different (lower) the child will get the rebellious tag. This tag will decrease parental relationship and parental relationship affects amount of happiness gained on family activities.

## 4 - Cutscene system

Cutscenes can take place anywhere. They will have 3d models of the characters doing a certain action in front of images. Dialogue will only be dialogue boxes, no voice acting.

Your childs 3d model will grow in 4 different states. Baby -> young child -> teen -> adult. They will be assigned a hair type at birth and sex. Then their clothing will adapt to their gender. Players can assign a colour to their child at birth (child might reject colour) but colour will represent clothing texture.

If major events occur (buy computer or tv, child/family member dies, get pet), they will affect items seen in home cutscenes. You can see the effect of choices in the home.
